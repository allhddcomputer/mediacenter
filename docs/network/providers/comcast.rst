Comcast
=======

We've had Comcast before, but we switched to :doc:`Verizon <verizon>` due to pricing and good internet speed. After :doc:`Frontier <frontier>` bought them, customer service went downhill, they constantly remotely reprogrammed our router (and denied it), and the pricing wasn't so optimal anymore.

We switched back to Comcast in June 2011.

In 2015 we executed a plan to :doc:`cut the cable <../../plans/cuttingthecable>`. We reduced our service from phone + TV + internet down to just internet in an effort to save money. We make up for the loss of TV content by using various :doc:`content service providers <../../services/index>` and we just use mobile phones for our primary contact.
