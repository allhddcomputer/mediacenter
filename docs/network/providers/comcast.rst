Comcast Xfinity
===============

We've had Comcast before, but we switched to :doc:`Verizon <verizon>` due to pricing and good internet speed. After :doc:`Frontier <frontier>` bought them, customer service went downhill, they constantly remotely reprogrammed our router (and denied it), and the pricing wasn't so optimal anymore.

We switched back to Comcast in June 2011.

In 2015 we started a plan to :doc:`cut the cable <../../plans/cuttingthecable>`. The idea would be to reduce our service from phone + TV + internet down to just internet.
