:doc:`Plex <plex>` is the centerpiece of my media center software. It provides access to pretty much all of my media in a nice, polished interface. That said, :doc:`Asset UPnP <asset>` is my primary mechanism for accessing music.

I use :doc:`DVDFab HD Decrypter <dvdfab>` and :doc:`MakeMKV <makemkv>` for ripping disc contents into digital format, then :doc:`Handbrake <handbrake>` for converting the ripped contents into a compatible format.

I use :doc:`Picasa <picasa>` for organizing my photos and :doc:`DVD Profiler <dvdprofiler>` for managing my DVD collection.

My digital music is in :doc:`iTunes <itunes>` but I keep track of the combined digital and disc music collection using :doc:`Music Collector <musiccollector>`.

My backup solution is :doc:`CrashPlan <crashplan>`, which handles both internal and off-site backup. That, combined with the workstation image-based backup of :doc:`Windows Home Server <whs>`, has me covered.
