PhotoDirector
=============

`CyberLink PhotoDirector <https://www.cyberlink.com/products/photodirector-ultra/features_en_US.html>`_ is the program I use to manage my photo collection.

I do have my photos indexed in :doc:`Plex <../serve/plex>` for easy viewing, but for general management, tagging, etc., I'm using PhotoDirector. I picked this up after Google dropped support for :doc:`Picasa <../deprecated/picasa>`.

From a general photo management standpoint the software works really well, however, I have found no end of trouble with the face tagging feature. The more face tags you have, the slower the tagging feature works to detect new faces. Also I have lost my face tag data twice now over software upgrades. As such, I've stopped doing face tagging.
