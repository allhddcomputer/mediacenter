===================
Deprecated Software
===================

As I transition away from using certain software packages, I don't want to lose the information I gathered while I was still using them. That info is moved down here, into an archive area about the software no longer in my system. Maybe it'll help me later with "lessons learned," or maybe someone still using this software can get something from it.
