Lip Sync Issues
===============

I discovered after the first round of scanning movies that there were issues with graininess, cropping, and lip sync on some movies. I rescanned them. After rescan, these still had some issues:

- Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) - Possible naturally bad sync. Everything is off by just a couple of frames.
- Christmas Vacation (1989) - Possible naturally bad sync. Some scenes are right on, some are off by a couple of frames.
- Elf (2003) - Possible naturally bad sync. Some scenes are right on, some are off by a couple of frames.
- Eraser (1996) - Possible naturally bad sync. Some scenes are right on, some are off by a couple of frames.
- GI Jane (1997) - Possible naturally bad sync. Some scenes are right on, some are off by a couple of frames.
- Iron Monkey (1993) - Almost looks like the wrong language, but this is apparently normal for some Cantonese films - they overdub themselves.
- It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie (2002) - Possible naturally bad sync. Everything is just a little off.
- Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) - This is a variable frame rate movie and it seems to have naturally bad sync. Switching to constant frame rate makes some of the sections stutter.
- Labyrinth (1986) - Possible naturally bad sync.
- Lethal Weapon (the entire series) - All of these seem to have naturally bad sync.
- Maverick (1994) - Possible naturally bad sync. Some scenes are right on, some are off by a couple of frames.

I stopped tracking the complete list. It kind of sucks, but it is what it is.
