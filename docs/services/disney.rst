We subscribed to `Disney+ <https://www.disneyplus.com>`_ when it first came out as part of a special promotional deal - two years for the price of one, or something like that. As time has gone on, it's actually become a pretty good source of original content and we'll likely continue subscribing along with the rest of our services.
