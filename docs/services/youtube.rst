YouTube Music
=============

In December 2019 I got a family plan to `YouTube Music <https://music.youtube.com>`_. This started as Google Play Music and we switched to it from :doc:`Pandora <pandora>` because we were using our Google Home / Google Assistant devices a lot more. Google/YouTube music integrates better with this scenario, allowing for easier access to specific songs/albums and integrating with the Google Family - something we already had set up for other reasons.
