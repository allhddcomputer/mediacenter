We subscribe to several services for providing digital content.

Video is generally served up by :doc:`Netflix <netflix>`, :doc:`Hulu <hulu>`, or :doc:`Amazon Prime Video <amazon>`. Music is :doc:`Pandora <pandora>`.

I don't generally purchase digital-only video content. I talk a bit more about that in the :doc:`media formats section <../formats/index>`.
