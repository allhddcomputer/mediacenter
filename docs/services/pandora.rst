Pandora

`Pandora <http://www.pandora.com>`_ provides a nice streaming music service that somewhat "learns" what you like based on you rating the music it plays.

I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years. My primary use is at work, listening to things as I take care of business. However, it plays well through most of our :doc:`front-end devices <../hardware/frontend/index>` and I find most :doc:`receivers <../hardware/receiver/index>` have Pandora clients built in, too.

The trouble I find with Pandora is potentially more a problem with *how I use Pandora*. I start off a station with a song or artist I'd like to hear, but as the day progresses and I rate various songs, I invariably end up with effectively the same station every time. I can start off with just about any artist and after a week end up with a station that plays overproduced pop music (which, I admit, is a guilty pleasure of mine). I find that I have to be very stalwart in my recommendations and not just respond on whether or not I like a given song but also whether or not the song appropriately fits the mood I want to keep on that particular station.
