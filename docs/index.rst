Illig Media Center
==================

This documentation provides an overview of my media center solution including how I set it up, what choices I made and how I made them, and how it all comes together.

I had been `blogging <http://www.paraesthesia.com>`_ this information, but given the rate with which it changes, I switched to documentation on `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ so I could more easily keep things up to date.

:doc:`Please read the disclaimer. <disclaimer>` You may find things in here that appear "wrong" or that don't work for you. I've addressed that :doc:`in my over-arching, all-encompassing disclaimer <disclaimer>`.
