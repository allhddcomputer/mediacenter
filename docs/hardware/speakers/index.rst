Speakers
========

I have two rooms with dedicated :doc:`receivers <../receiver/index>`. The downstairs family room, where we primarily watch TV, has a set of :doc:`Bose Acoustimass 16 <acoustimass16>` speakers attached. The upstairs game room, where we hang out or generally just play games, has :doc:`Mirage MX satellite speakers <miragemx>`.
