Yamaha RX-V777BT
================

I picked up my Yamaha RX-V777BT receiver in February 2015 after my :doc:`Onkyo TX-SR875 <../deprecated/onkyotxsr875>` receiver blew out its audio circuitry. `I picked it up at Amazon for around $800. <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ILCS164?tag=mhsvortex>`_

The setup on it was easy and the feature set is just right for me. It also came with a Bluetooth adapter that lets me play music from my phone right to the receiver, like a giant portable Bluetooth speaker.

**The killer feature, for me, is the standby HDMI passthrough.** It allows you to turn the receiver off (well, put it in standby mode) and still allow HDMI signals to be selected and pass through the receiver. You can watch stuff just through the TV without having to turn on the whole surround system.
