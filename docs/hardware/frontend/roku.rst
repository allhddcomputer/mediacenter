Roku Ultra
==========

When we upgraded to our 4K :doc:`Samsung UN65KS8000 <../tv/samsungun65ks8000>` we upgraded the Roku 3 to a Roku Ultra.

For the most part it's been nice, but in around February 2017 we encountered two issues.

First, the Netflix app doesn't seem to stream as fast as it should. Our Internet connection speed tests out at 150Mbps but the Netflix app internal speed test generally tops out at 30Mbps. When it dips lower than that, we get artifacts when streaming 4K content. I don't know if there's some sort of traffic shaping going on at Comcast or what, but it's frustrating.

Second, with the 7.5.1 release of the Roku Ultra firmware, I am, along with many others, encountering `a random pop/chirp noise in all channels. <https://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=98931&p=555044#p555044>`_ I'm hoping they fix that soon.

Roku 3
======

I picked up a `Roku 3 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGGDVOO?tag=mhsvortex>`_ after doing some comparison work between :doc:`Chromecast <chromecast>`, `Roku 3 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGGDVOO?tag=mhsvortex>`_, `Apple TV <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007I5JT4S?tag=mhsvortex>`_, and `Amazon Fire TV <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CX5P8FC?tag=mhsvortex>`_.

While the Amazon site has `a comparison of Fire TV to Roku <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CX5P8FC?tag=mhsvortex>`_ and it appears to win (of course), `the majority of third-party reviews rank Roku 3 as the winner <http://www.cnet.com/news/chromecast-vs-apple-tv-vs-roku-3-which-media-streamer-should-you-buy/>`_.

`Roku has a Tablo channel <https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-rockin-roku/>`_ so viewing :doc:`Tablo DVR <../server/tablo>` content is directly supported. It's very smooth and easily supports the highest quality Tablo recordings.

Plex Channel
============

With some of my HD movies that the Plex channel will occasionally hang unexpectedly and just stop playing. I found that going into the Plex channel/app settings, under Transcoder, unchecking "Direct Stream" seems to fix it.
