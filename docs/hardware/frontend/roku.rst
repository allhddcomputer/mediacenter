Roku 3
======

I picked up a `Roku 3 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGGDVOO?tag=mhsvortex>`_ after doing some comparison work between :doc:`Chromecast <chromecast>`, `Roku 3 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGGDVOO?tag=mhsvortex>`_, `Apple TV <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007I5JT4S?tag=mhsvortex>`_, and `Amazon Fire TV <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CX5P8FC?tag=mhsvortex>`_.

While the Amazon site has `a comparison of Fire TV to Roku <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CX5P8FC?tag=mhsvortex>`_ and it appears to win (of course), `the majority of third-party reviews rank Roku 3 as the winner <http://www.cnet.com/news/chromecast-vs-apple-tv-vs-roku-3-which-media-streamer-should-you-buy/>`_.

`Roku has a Tablo channel <https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-rockin-roku/>`_ so viewing :doc:`Tablo DVR <../server/tablo>` content is directly supported. It's very smooth and easily supports the highest quality Tablo recordings.

Roku Ultra
==========

I ended up :doc:`deprecating the Roku Ultra <../deprecated/roku>` after I suffered through six months of total unreliability and lack of tech support response. I switched to :doc:`NVIDIA Shield TV <nvidiashield>` for the 4K support and Google Home integration.

Plex Channel
============

With some of my HD movies the Plex channel will occasionally hang unexpectedly and just stop playing. I found that going into the Plex channel/app settings, under Transcoder, unchecking "Direct Stream" seems to fix it.

Secret Menus
============

Roku has some secret settings menus for advanced users. *Use at your own risk.* I haven't really done much with these. To reach the menus, press the keys on the remote as listed:

- Secret Menu #1: Home (x5), FF (x3), RW (x2)
- Secret Menu #2: Home (x5), Up, Right, Down, Left, Up
- Wi-Fi Menu: Home (x5), Up, Down, Up, Down, Up
- Platform Menu: Home (x5), FF, Pause, RW, Pause, FF
- Antenna Menu: Home (x5), FF, Down, RW, Down, FF
- Bit Rate Menu: Home (x5), RW (x3), FF (x2)
- Developer Menu: Home (x3), Up (x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, Left
- Network Menu: Home (x5), Right, Left, Right, Left, Right
- Reboot Device: Home (x5), Up, RW (x2), FF (x2)

There is a nice infographic of these commands `on the Lifehacker site <http://lifehacker.com/all-the-roku-secret-commands-and-menus-in-one-graphic-1779010902>`_.
