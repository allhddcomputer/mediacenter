Front-End Devices
=================

When looking for a front-end device, I generally want:

- **Access to services I use**: Minimally :doc:`Netflix <../../services/netflix>`, :doc:`Hulu Plus <../../services/hulu>`, and :doc:`Amazon Prime Video <../../services/amazon>`. Nice to have is :doc:`Pandora <../../services/pandora>`.
- **Plex**: I'm using :doc:`Plex <../../software/serve/plex>` for my own media, so this is a total requirement.
- **Easy to use**: I want this thing to be so easy to use that no one in my household complains about using it.
- **Stable network connectivity**: I don't mind if it uses wireless, and I have a decent :doc:`network setup <../../network/index>`, but I want it to be stable/consistent. I prefer wired over wireless, though.
