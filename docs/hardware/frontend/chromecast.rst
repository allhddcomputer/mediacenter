I picked up a `Google Chromecast <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR0PDNE?tag=mhsvortex>`_ before I did too much evaluation or research on :doc:`front-end devices <../index>`.

While I found it was an interesting concept, **I had a lot of challenge with it around networking**.

Regardless of how I positioned it, I could never get it to keep a good high-quality wireless signal. Of the "four bars" of quality it displays, two bars was pretty much all I could consistently keep, even in the room right next to the wireless access point.

What this resulted in was an inordinate amount of buffering when watching :doc:`Netflix <../../services/netflix>`, in some cases enough so that I wouldn't get an HD picture until 10-15 minutes into the show.

One day after watching two or three shows on it, I left the room and came back a few hours later. I couldn't get the Chromecast to consistently connect to the network *at all*. I reset it to factory defaults several times and never could get it to reconnect.

I did some simple searches and found that this is actually a pretty common problem with the Chromecast - the wireless connectivity always seems to be mentioned in bad reviews.

**I've given up on the Chromecast as anything more than a toy.** It doesn't really meet my "easy to use" :doc:`front-end device requirement <index>` and it definitely doesn't stay consistently connected.
