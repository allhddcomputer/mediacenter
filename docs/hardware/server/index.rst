- On the top is the :doc:`Synology DS1010+ <synologyds1010>`, which provides all storage; and the :doc:`Tablo <tablo>`, which handles over-the-air DVR services.
- The middle has the :doc:`HP EX475 Home Server <../deprecated/hpex475>`, deprecated and removed in late 2017.
- On the far right, the mini tower is :doc:`Megaplex <megaplex>`, my custom dedicated Plex server.
