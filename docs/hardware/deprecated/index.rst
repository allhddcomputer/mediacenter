===================
Deprecated Hardware
===================

As my system grows and changes, I switch up the hardware driving the system. Once I've moved away from a piece of hardware, whether it's dead or just unused, I don't want to lose the information I gathered while I was still using it. That info is moved down here, into an archive area about the hardware no longer in my system. Maybe it'll help me later with "lessons learned," or maybe someone still using this hardware can get something from it.
