Samsung LN52A750
================

This is our current primary TV. It's an LCD set that runs at 1920x1080 for a full HD picture. It's 52" and has a glossy display. Controls are along the bottom right inside the bezel - you have to run your hand over the bezel to get them to light up.

I've been a fan of the Samsung LCD/LED TVs since we started researching this one and picked it up. The clarity on the picture is amazing and the colors are great. Darks are also reasonably dark, though some of the newer sets on the market do better.

The glossy display adds to the clarity of the picture, but I do need to basically keep the blinds in the room with the TV shut because any significant amount of light causes so much glare you can't see anything.

There's `a wireless adapter for this TV <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GIP4TC?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001GIP4TC>`_ but **it only enables the InfoLink capabilities** (news, weather, stocks) - it doesn't enable the DLNA sharing. I never ended up getting the adapter... and the DLNA client is pretty weak, so I don't even have the TV itself hooked to the network.
