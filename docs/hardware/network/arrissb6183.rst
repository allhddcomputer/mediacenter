Arris SURFboard SB6183
======================

I finally bought my own cable modem in March 2016. `We got the Arris SURFboard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem from Amazon for about $100. <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA5U1FW?tag=mhsvortex>`_

Setup was pretty easy but did require I activate the modem `using the Comcast instructions <http://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/activate-purchased-modem/>`_ and reboot all of my network devices. Making sure things got rebooted in the right order was the hardest part of the process. I had to ensure that the modem picked up the router as the MAC address of the connected device and *then* connect my computer to the router to activate the modem. I got it wrong the first time and had my computer connected directly to the modem so when I connected the router things stopped working. Didn't take long to fix it up, but was a little tedious.
