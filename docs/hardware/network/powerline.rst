Powerline Network Adapters
==========================

I use powerline adapters to get wired network from downstairs, where my cable modem and router are, to the upstairs, where we have various devices requiring connectivity. Wireless is great and all, but for a decent, reliable connection, nothing beats wired.

Plus, with the wire upstairs, I can add an :doc:`access point <dap1522>` up there and get good wireless coverage around the house.

Netgear XAVB5101 500MBps
========================
My primary link from downstairs to upstairs is via a `pair of Netgear Powerline 500 Nano XAVB5101 units <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009WG6JF8?tag=mhsvortex>`_. These work at a peak speed of 500MBps, which is more than enough to satisfy some HD streaming and serve as the connection to the upstairs :doc:`wireless access point <dap1522>`.

While these are supposed to work alongside the XAVB1201 adapters, after adding them into the mix the XAVB1201 adapters became unreliable, as though the signals were incompatible.

Netgear XAVB1201 100MBps
========================

I have `some Netgear XAVB1201 units <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTPEXU?tag=mhsvortex>`_ for less-frequently used connections like the master bedroom. These work at an effective speed of 100MBps and are just fine for HD video to a single room.
