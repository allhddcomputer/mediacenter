===============================

I picked up the `ChannelMaster CM 3000 SMARTenna <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BSKO84?tag=mhsvortex>`_ during :doc:`my plan to cut the cable <../../plans/cuttingthecable>`. It was a reasonable balance between cost, functionality, and ease of installation.

It was very easy to mount and it's paintable, so it blends right in. Here's a photo of the installed antenna, right above the light in the front of my house. I painted it white so you barely notice it. I also put some wire grating above it so animals don't make a home up there.

So far it has worked fairly well, though when the weather gets bad the reception gets a little flakey. I may consider upgrading to a larger antenna in the future.
