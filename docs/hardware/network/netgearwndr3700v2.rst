Netgear WNDR3700v2
==================

I have `a Netgear WNDR3700v2 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRJY4?tag=mhsvortex>`_ as my primary router/wireless access point coming right off the cable modem.

I got a Netgear WNDR3700v2 for our router because it has:

- Gigabit ethernet ports.
- Simultaneous dual-band wireless-N networks.
- Guest networks.
- Nice admin interface.
- Reasonably high recommendations across several sites.

Everything went along fine for the first month or so and then we had several dropouts where the 2.4GHz network would just "disappear."" It would return after rebooting the router or simply visiting the router configuration page and clicking the "Apply" button on any setting page (without making any changes). After upgrading to the latest firmware, the issue went away.
