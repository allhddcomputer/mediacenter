Netgear WNDR3700v2
==================

I have `a Netgear WNDR3700v2 <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRJY4?tag=mhsvortex>`_ as my primary router/wireless access point coming right off the cable modem.

I got a Netgear WNDR3700v2 for our router because it has:

- Gigabit ethernet ports.
- Simultaneous dual-band wireless-N networks.
- Guest networks.
- Nice admin interface.
- Reasonably high recommendations across several sites.

Everything went along fine for the first month or so and then we had several dropouts where the 2.4GHz network would just "disappear."" It would return after rebooting the router or simply visiting the router configuration page and clicking the "Apply" button on any setting page (without making any changes). After upgrading to the latest firmware, the issue went away.

The downside to this particular router, I'm finding, is the wireless power/range. The office where the network comes in is on the bottom floor of my house on one side and there's not a great way to reposition it - :doc:`powerline <powerline>` isn't really fast enough and I don't have wires run to the upstairs. What this results in is about 50% signal at best upstairs in the house, and less in some cases. The antenna for the router is internal and somewhat small so I may have to upgrade.

In the meantime, I have the :doc:`DAP-1522 <dap1522>` upstairs over :doc:`powerline <powerline>` to try bridging the gap with wireless roaming until I find some better solution.
