All of my devices are, at a minimum, plugged into proper surge protection devices. In some cases, like the servers, I have UPS (uninterruptable power supply - battery backup) units that can save me in the event of an outage.

CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD

`I picked up two of these CP1500AVRLCD units <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBK3QK?tag=mhsvortex>`_ after the Tripp-Lite OMNI900LCD units died. I really like these. They have a good capacity, plus the battery inside is replaceable so I can hopefully avoid the issue I had with the other units.

One of these is in the living room for the TV, receiver, and other front-end devices; one of these is in the office sharing the server load with an APS Back-Ups 550.
