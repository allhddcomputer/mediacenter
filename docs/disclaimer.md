# Disclaimer

Rather than say this on _every single page_, I'll put one top-level, all encompassing disclaimer on the whole of the site.

- **What worked for me may not work for you.** The docs here are to help you or let you know what I did for my situation. I can't promise the solution will work for your specific circumstances and I'm not interested in writing an all-encompassing how-to guide for every scenario.
- **Everything is as current as I can make it.** I will do my best to link to authoritative sources and systems of record where possible, but in things like product comparisons I may show specs or prices that were _current at the time I did the comparison_. They may not be current _literally as of today_. Unless I am in the process of re-evaluating something, I will probably not be updating these things all the time.
