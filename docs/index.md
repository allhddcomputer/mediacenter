# Illig Media Center

This documentation provides an overview of my media center solution including how I set it up, what choices I made and how I made them, and how it all comes together.

I had been [blogging](http://www.paraesthesia.com) this information, but given the rate with which it changes, I switched to documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) so I could more easily keep things up to date.

**[Please read the disclaimer.](disclaimer.md)** You may find things in here that appear "wrong" or that don't work for you. I've addressed that [in my over-arching, all-encompassing disclaimer](disclaimer.md).
