Home Video Intake Process
=========================

This is the process I go through when I pull home videos off of phones or cameras to add to my collection. Following this process helps me ensure I keep everything organized and backed up. Plus, with a consistent organization, I can easily find things later.

My home video intake process is very similar to my :doc:`photo intake process <photo>` and usually takes place at the same time because the devices with home videos usually also photos.

Video Organization
==================

I organize my home videos in folders by year and name them by date/time with a small description. For example, you might see a layout like this in my home videos folder::

    videos/
        2012/
        2013/
        2014/
        2015/
            20150103_132230 Crazy Cat.mp4
            20150112_165211 Phoenix Dancing.mp4

Intake Process
==============

1. Download the videos from the device onto my computer desktop.
2. Rename the files to a format like ``YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`` (e.g., ``21050611_113812.mp4``) based on the original date/time the video was taken. I'll also add a small description to the name like ``20150103_132230 Crazy Cat.mp4``.
3. Put all the videos into the folder of the year in which they were taken.
