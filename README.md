# My Media Center

This repo houses documentation, diagrams, and info on my media center setup. I had been blogging this information, but given the rate with which it changes, I switched to [a repository rendered with ReadTheDocs](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/) so I could more easily keep things up to date.

**[Read the docs!](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/)**

## MkDocs
For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org).

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
